OpenQ-Cake is a question and answer script similar to popular Q&A site 0 stackoverflow.com

The project was initially started as a training project for interns however couldn't be finished due to time limitations. However the project is 70% complete (functionally) and we thought to open sourcing the project so others can contribute and use/customize/fork the script as per your needs.

It's developed using CakePHP 1.3 and it's a work of 3 weeks so you may find lot of bugs and many default views (generated by cake's bake script).

To summarize, below is a brief list of features available as of now (not all may be fully functional though most of it should be in place)

>> Users registration using Auth
>> Facebook connect/Open ID integration (base work done, need to fully integrate)
>> Question voting (Ajax) 
>> Answers voting (Ajax)
>> Ajax Pagination - Has some paging issues
>> Ask/Answer functionality (registered users only)
>> Questions comments
>> Answers comments

As mentioned above, the most of the base work is done and the script is not ready for production use by any means. For example, though voting is available but there is no check for stopping user from voting multiple times on same question/answer. 

We will try to continue working on the project. You are free to use the code.
